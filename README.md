Arabic page numbering starting from the front matter.

This package modifies the definitions of \frontmatter and
\mainmatter so that page numbering starts in arabic style from the
front matter while preserving the rest of the original definitions.
For it to work, \pagenumbering has to be inside these macros -- most
of classes do that, but there are exceptions like memoir.

To use it, just \usepackage{arabicfront}.
